##  Join the Le Wagon's Azure  Environment

Please ensure you accept the invitation you've received via email to join the "Le Wagon Azure Organization." This step is crucial for accessing specific resources and collaborations for this course. Check your inbox (and spam folder, just in case) for the invitation and follow the instructions provided to join. These steps will allow you to connect to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). 

Note that you may need to install and use Microsoft Authenticator in your phone to login to Microsoft Azure. Then, you will be able to sign-in Azure through your phone.  The Authenticator app shows a message to enter a number in the app. You can find this number when you try to sign-in Azure from your browser. When the correct number is selected, the sign-in process is complete.
